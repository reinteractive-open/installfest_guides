# Set up your Development Environment

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Rails

First, you must have a working version of Rails. Depending on your operating system, there is a different guide to follow:

* **Mac** users please use [this guide on installing Rails](/guides/installfest/rails_on_mac)
* **Windows** users please use [this guide on installing Rails](/guides/installfest/rails_on_windows)
* **Linux** users, you may refer to [gorails guide](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04)

### 2. Download a Text Editor (if required)

You will also need a text editor in which to write your code. If you already have one installed, feel free to skip this step. We use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

If you prefer another text editor like [Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) or Github's [Atom](https://atom.io/) that's fine too but these instructions will specifically mention Sublime.

## Next steps

Once you've successfully installed Rails you're ready to start.

First we need to determine which version of Rails you're using. Open a command prompt and type:

```
rails -v
```

Ideally, this should be Rails 5.

## Get Coding!

* **For Rails version 5 use our [version 5 guide](/guides/installfest/getting_started)**

### Older Versions of Rails

If you have an earlier version of Rails you can find the correct guide here:

* For Rails version 4.2 continue on our [version 4.2 guide](/guides/installfest42/getting_started)
* For Rails version 4.1 continue on our [version 4.1 guide](/guides/installfest41/getting_started)
* For Rails version 4.0 continue on our [version 4.0 guide](/guides/installfest40/getting_started)
* For Rails version 3.2 continue on our [version 3.2 guide](/guides/installfest32/getting_started)
